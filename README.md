# ML-project-PREDICTING-QUALITY-OF-WINE
This analysis examines data from wine concentrating on relationship between a key list of sweetness, acidity, tannin levels, alcohol using them to try and predict the quality of wine.  In general, models such as this derived of much larger data sets will eventually evolve to produce better quality out comes with less invasive methods by predicting possible quality of wine. Where we find out the Ph and alcohol quality in it to find the best quality of wine.so that the prediction of quality takes place. The dataset contains information about red and white wine. The dataset has 1600 data points of each wine with 12 characteristics(attributes). Wine quality is measured on 3,4,5(low)-6,7,8(high) scale. Management wants to understand the characteristics of these wines and how different ingredients affect the quality.
